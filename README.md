## Features

- **User Input for Event Date and Time**: Users can input a specific date and time for an upcoming event. The application then calculates the time remaining and displays it in a dynamic countdown format.
- **Real-Time Countdown Display**: The timer updates every second, providing a live countdown to the event.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## How to Use

   - Open the application in a web browser.
   - Enter the desired event date and time in the input fields provided.

2. **Start the Countdown**:
   - Click the "Start" button to initiate the countdown.
   - The timer will display the time remaining until the event in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

3. **Reset or Adjust the Timer**:

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the application, including input fields for date and time, and the display area for the countdown timer.
- **style.css**: Provides styling for the application, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for calculating the time difference between the current time and the event time, and updating the countdown display accordingly.

## Implementation Details

- **Time Calculation**: The application calculates the difference between the current date and time and the user-specified event date and time. This difference is then broken down into days, hours, minutes, and seconds for display.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Using JavaScript's `setInterval` function, the countdown display is updated every second to reflect the decreasing time until the event
- **Input Validation**: The application includes basic validation to ensure that the user inputs a valid date and time that is in the future.
